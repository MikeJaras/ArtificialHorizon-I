# ArtificialHorizon

Using an Arduino UNO, a Waveshare 128x128 1.5" OLED and an Adafruit BN055 gyroscope we create a simple artificial horizon 
and directional indicator that works upright and inverted. Not for use in flight... for educational purposes only.

There is a youtube description of this project here: <link TBA>
